# Finnish Python NLP

Final project for the Building AI course.

## Summary

Simple NLP sentiment analysis for short Finnish texts. Classifies the sentiment of the text as positive, neutral or negative. 

## Background

English Language has a wide variety of open source sentiment analysis libraries as well as commercial sentiment analysis APIs. This has been a constant source of frustration to me since I do not have such luxuries available for my native Finnish language.  

## How is it used?

Install it yourself or try it online on [https://finnish-python-nlp.herokuapp.com/](https://finnish-python-nlp.herokuapp.com/). Chatbot version coming soon. 

## Data sources and AI methods


## Challenges

Finnish language is obviously very hard to parse. The sentiment analysis will take some context-specific shortcuts.  

## What next?

The project might also include entity and intent recognition at a later stage.
